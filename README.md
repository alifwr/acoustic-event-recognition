# acoustic-event-recognition
Acoustic Event Detection system for Home Monitoring system. The system works by recording audio signal from the surround environment. The audio data then are chopped into some part, and the system will do the Feature Extraction process of each part to get the Spectrogram image data. Spectrogram contains the information of the audio in form of an image. These images then fed into the Convolutional Neural Networks Model to recognize what kind of event is the recorded data. All those processes were implemented on Raspberry Pi as the Edge Device. These works also published in International Electronics Symposium Conference 2020.
